;;; README --- Terca Grapher
Version 0.5

This is the first release that can draw 2d and 3d functions.
This version is almost entirely non-optimized, so expect it
to be pretty slow. On the other hand, the code is very
accessible.

Overview
========

Terca Grapher is a (currently) command line based grapher
using OpenGL and GLFW to display results. It should be run
from a graphical environment from a command line.

It can graph any (in theory) 2D or 3D graph with variables
x, y, and z. It can differentiate between them automatically.

Installing
==========

cmake based installation:

cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install (optional)

Running
=======

Open a shell:

tercagrapher [equation]

Where equation is:

[expression containing x || y || z] = [expression containing x || y || z]

N.B. "x", "y", and "z" must be lower case.

Libraries
=========

Terca Grapher uses muparser and KGraph libraries.
Licenses for these can be found in MUPARSER_LICENSE
and KGRAPH_LICENSE respectively.

Terca Grapher also uses the Terca C++ Vector library.
This library can be found on the TercaTech Github
near this program.

Documentation
=============

For now, this is the documentation. Eventually, more
will be written
